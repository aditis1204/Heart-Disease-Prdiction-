# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch
* Heart is the vital organ of human body, any problem in it reflects on other organs. So our aim is to develop a tool analyse a person has heart disease or not on basis of the given factors which are age,sex, cholesterol and more
* The dataset is taken from UCI.  It has 303 instances and 14 attributes with some null values
* The dataset contains age,sex,chest pain, resting resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, maximum heart rate, exercise induced angina, oldpeak, slope, number of vessels colored and thalassemia. The final target or class has values 0,1,2,3 and 4. 0 signifies absence of disease and other show disease presence. For classification we have classified using Neural Networks considering total 5 classes and later on we converted the data to binary classification and implemented SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression
